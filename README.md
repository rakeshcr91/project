# Community Portal

This repository contains a small Reddit-like application built with Flask.
All application code resides in the `community_portal/` directory.
The portal showcases an advanced UI styled with multiple CSS frameworks, including a Bootswatch theme and a React-powered feed with an admin dashboard.
See its README for details and running instructions.
